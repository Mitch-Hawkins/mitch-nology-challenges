Challenge: 
- Create a Dog class 
- Dog should have at least the fields name and breed, but you might need more for some of the other parts of the challenge 
- You should be able to create several instances of Dog
- Each instance should have the following methods
 - `walk(distance)` 
 - `totalWalkDistance()` which will return the total distance walked by that particular dog
- `averageWalkDistance()` returns the average distance that this dog has been walked
- `walkSummary()` this should print to the console a summary of all the walks a dog has taken 

## BONUS 
- Research the 'static' keyword for classes
- Create a static method for Dog `getByBreed(breed). This should return all dogs of a certain breed
- `averageWalkDistance()` This should be a static method on the dog class which returns the average walk distance across **all** Dogs`
