# Routing in React

React allows us to build single page applications
We only have one html file

We still want to do things like have an About me page and a contact page

React doesn't come with inbuilt support for that

We will use a library that will help us deal with it

## React router dom

```
npm i react-router-dom
```

-   Home page: localhost:5173/
-   About me: localhost:5173/about-me
-   Contact: localhost:5173/contact

    +a working navbar that will redirect to those urls

SOmething extra we will add later on (separate from routing)

### Json server
